Built a Python-based RAT PoC for authorized red-team research, with full code obfuscation/encryption and persistence to evaluate Windows detection gaps.

Analyzed Windows Defender and cloud-based file-scanning behavior (e.g., email attachments) to understand evasion patterns and improve defensive hardening.

Tested RDP configurations, Registry modifications, and connection persistence in a controlled environment to assess remote-access security.
